# Ablation Study: No Bayesian Beliefs
# Tests system without opponent modeling (V1 configuration)

# Inherits from default.yaml but disables Bayesian Beliefs
_base_: ../default.yaml

experiment:
  name: ablation_no_beliefs
  description: >
    This ablation disables the Bayesian Belief module to measure
    its contribution to decision-making under uncertainty.

modules:
  use_trust_gate: true
  use_beliefs: false  # V1 mode
  use_world_model: false

beliefs:
  enabled: false
  # Without beliefs, agent uses reactive policy without opponent modeling

# Expected Results:
# - Decreased performance against strategic opponents
# - May perform similarly against random/stationary opponents
# - Faster inference (no belief update overhead)

ablation_notes:
  hypothesis: Bayesian Beliefs improve performance against strategic adversaries
