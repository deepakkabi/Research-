# Ablation Study: No Safety Shield
# Tests system without hard safety constraints

# Inherits from default.yaml but disables Safety Shield
_base_: ../default.yaml

experiment:
  name: ablation_no_shield
  description: >
    This ablation disables the Safety Shield module to measure
    its contribution to constraint satisfaction and safe behavior.

modules:
  use_trust_gate: true
  use_beliefs: true
  use_world_model: false

safety:
  enabled: false
  # When disabled, proposed actions are executed without verification

# Expected Results:
# - Higher constraint violations (protected entity breaches)
# - Potentially higher task rewards (no safety blocking)
# - Demonstrates need for hard safety guarantees

ablation_notes:
  hypothesis: Safety Shield is essential for guaranteed constraint satisfaction
  metrics_to_track:
    - constraint_violation_rate
    - protected_entity_breaches
    - proportionality_violations
    - resource_constraint_violations
