# Ablation Study: No Trust Gate
# Tests system robustness without Byzantine fault tolerance

# Inherits from default.yaml but disables Trust Gate
_base_: ../default.yaml

experiment:
  name: ablation_no_trust
  description: >
    This ablation disables the Trust Gate module to measure 
    its contribution to system robustness under Byzantine attacks.

modules:
  use_trust_gate: false
  use_beliefs: true
  use_world_model: false

# Expected Results:
# - Decreased robustness to corrupted messages
# - Higher susceptibility to Byzantine agents
# - May show better performance in clean environments (less filtering overhead)

ablation_notes:
  hypothesis: Trust Gate is critical for robustness under adversarial conditions
  metrics_to_track:
    - task_success_rate
    - coordination_failure_rate
    - byzantine_attack_resistance
